# LauzHack 2019

This project was developed during a 24-hour Hackathon hosted in Lausanne, Switzerland. We aimed to develop a Deep Learning system that is able to predict the popularity of a meme and also provide a comment to it. We developed the model using Keras in Python and trained it using memes from [r/dankmemes](https://reddit.com/r/dankmemes).

The project submission and more information about it can be found at [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/pewdeepai).
