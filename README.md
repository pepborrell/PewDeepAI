# PewDeepAI

This project was developed during LauzHack 2019, a 24-hour Hackathon hosted in Lausanne, Switzerland in November 2019. We aimed to develop a Deep Learning system that is able to predict the popularity of a meme and also provide a comment to it. We developed the model using Keras in Python and trained it using memes from [r/dankmemes](https://reddit.com/r/dankmemes).
